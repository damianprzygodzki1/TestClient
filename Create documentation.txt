React Countries App
This application is a comprehensive React.js-based frontend interface that connects to the REST COUNTRIES API. Through its intuitive UI, users can retrieve a wide range of details about various countries. Specifically, the app provides a filtering form that enables users to search based on the common name of a country, or filter results according to population size. To enhance usability, users can also sort the list of countries by their common names and limit the number of entries displayed on a single page, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

The primary goal of this React application is to provide users with a smooth interface to quickly find and view country-specific details without navigating through a plethora of data. The ease of filtering and sorting ensures that users can narrow down their searches and access precise information about countries without any hassle. Whether you're a researcher, student, or someone who just loves geography, this tool is built to cater to your needs.

Examples of How to Use:
Search by Country Name: Enter the common name of a country in the search bar, such as "Canada", to quickly view details about that country.
Filter by Population: Use the population filter to view countries with a population greater than, for instance, 50 million people.
Sorting Countries: By default, countries may be listed in the order they are fetched. Use the 'Sort by Name' option to have them alphabetically arranged.
Limit Entries: If you wish to view only 10 countries at a time, select the limit option and choose '10'.
Broad Searches: Entering a common prefix like "Uni" can display countries like "United States", "United Kingdom", etc.
Population Ranges: You can specify a population range to display countries within that range, e.g., countries with populations between 10 million and 50 million.
Combine Filters: Combine the common name and population filters to narrow down your search. For instance, find countries with the name containing "Island" and a population less than 1 million.
Pagination: If you've limited entries, use pagination to navigate between different pages of country listings.
Reset Filters: After several searches, easily reset all filters and sorting options to view the complete list of countries again.
View Details: Click on any country's name to get detailed information about the country, like its capital, region, subregion, and more.
