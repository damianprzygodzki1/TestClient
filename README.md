# React Countries App with REST COUNTRIES API
This application is a dynamic web platform built using React.js that connects to the REST COUNTRIES API to fetch and display country data. Users can interact with a filtering form which allows them to sift through countries based on their common name or by their population count. Additionally, the application provides the functionality to sort the displayed countries alphabetically by their common name. To enhance user experience and provide a seamless browsing experience, users can also limit the number of country entries that appear in the resultant table.

The design is user-centric and has been optimized for ease of use. The filtering and sorting functionalities are intuitive, ensuring that users, regardless of their technical proficiency, can seamlessly navigate through the extensive list of countries and find the data they are interested in.
